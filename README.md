It is my second attempt to finish the specialization 
on Recommender systems from [University of Minnesota](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/recommender-systems) but unlike the first time, I am attempting to complete all the assignments not only in Java but also in R - for the practice sake.

### Assignment # 1

The first assignment in the course ["Introduction to Recommender Systems: Non-Personalized and Content-Based"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/recommender-systems-introduction) will "explore non-personalized and lightly-personalized recommendations" and includes sever deliverables with each deliverable representing a different analysis of the data provided."The first three deliverables represent non-personalized summary statistics; the next two represent product association using two different mechanisms (we aren't using lift here because of how similar the popularity levels are). The last two represent a demographic analysis to explore whether using gender would be wise given this dataset."

See the code to the first assignment [here](https://github.com/eponkratova/recommender-intro/blob/master/assg1_knit.Rmd).

### Assignment # 2

In this assignment, one will hand-create and use some content-based profiles. Heâ€™ll go through a set of variations to see how certain features of the computation can introduce (or reduce) biases.

See the code to the second assignment [here] (https://github.com/eponkratova/recommender-intro/blob/master/assg2.Rmd).
